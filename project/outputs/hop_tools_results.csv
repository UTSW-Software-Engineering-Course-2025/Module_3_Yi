### Step 3: Provide aliases
- The gene aliases are not listed in the summary I retrieved, but the official symbol for this gene is EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), which suggests a database mismatch. However, based on the BLAST results and common knowledge, the gene with your sequence is FCGR3A, not EGFR.

#### Corrected Approach:
- The correct gene should be FCGR3A (not EGFR), and its aliases typically include: CD16, CD16A, FCG3, FCGR3, IGFR3, and others.

PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP contains an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment and one intracytoplasmic catalytic domain, thus belongs to receptor type PTP. The extracellular region of this PTP is composed of multiple fibronectin type_III repeats, which was shown to interact with neuronal receptor and cell adhesion molecules, such as contactin and tenascin C. This protein was also found to interact with sodium channels, and thus may regulate sodium channels by altering tyrosine phosphorylation status.
